This project simulates a news DAO where users collaborate on sources for news/wiki articles. The webpage canister stores the news sources. Sources can be read by appending /article/<ARTICLE_ID> to the URL. Users can submit and vote on proposals that perform one out of three actions on these sources: add a source, update a source or remove a source. Once a proposal is met, the action is taken automatically. The frontend is built with React.
